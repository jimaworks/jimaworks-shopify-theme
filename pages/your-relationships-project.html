                Each consists of five Text Boxes for you to fill out. 
                Six Trip Visuals beautifully stage this bit of your history.
      Feb 08 2019:0940 Change prompt for name - add value="Our Family".  (But would like that to be overwritten on input)
      Feb 22 2019:0806 New prompt leads to "Our Family Family Atlantic Crossing" so remove redundancy (when condition Atlantic/Pacific?)
      Apr 15 2019:1230 Edit prompt to emphasize ability to edit or leave default "Our Family Family Atlantic Crossing"
      Apr 23 2019:0800 Put in "nextPage" convention.  Change subtitle to "Whose story is this?"
      Apr 25 2019:1430 Put in the correct "nextPage"'s to make it live.
      May 20 2019:0730 Bring final choice button to the top - make it overlay all else
      
      Changeover.  Insert at RelationShips introduction.

        The RelationShip and ArrivalMap products focus specifically on commemorating your "First Gens" 
        - those who made thee oceanic crossings that planted your family in America. 
        These products are personalized and specific. 
        They will take a bit of effort for you to fully specify (and for jimaworks to prepare). 
    </p>

        before your creation is ready to hang on a wall and do its good work. 
        Some elements of the project are fairly information-intensive, 
        but no matter what level of knowledge you have of the crossing you are commemorating, 
        you will be able to make the project reflect the honor and appreciation you give this event.

    <h3>Your part of this project will require completing three steps:</h3>
    <h4>Step 1: You provide some historical context for the commemoration 
        <br />Step 2: You choose a look and feel that suits your needs and tastes 
        <br />Step 3: You personalize the product.</h4>
    <h5>When you are satisfied that you have specified your commemoration to your liking, you place the order. 
        The first $25 of your order buys you a pdf of several variants of your specification. 
        You can chose your final, physical delivery from these, or simply stop there and use your lower-resolution pdfs to print and display*.</h5>

        <p>With the first $25 of the order, 
        jimaworks prepares a proof with at least two variations of the product as you have specified it. 
        These proofs include the historically accurate map corresponding to your commemorative event, 
        the ship (if any*) that you have chosen for the display, 
        and the custom text elements that individualize the product to your specific case.</p>
    <p>Jimaworks will send .pdfs of the proofs to the email address you have provided. 
        At that point you may simply accept one of the options we have provided, 
        or, if you desire, request a round of modifications. 
        You may also of course decline the options, 
        at which point we will refund your order minus a $25 service charge for designing your options. 
        (We will assume you have declined the options 
        if you do not respond within two weeks of receiving your personalized proofs).</p>
    <p>We are pleased that you are visiting this website 
        and hope you find our products of value in preserving and honoring the specifics of your Armerican identity. 
        We hope furthermore that you will make a RelationShips purchase 
        to help us memorialize the great migrations 
        which are such a fundamental component of our shared American heritage.</p>

    <p>Each of these TextBoxes will already be filled in for you and updated as you add information. The more information you provide, the more "yours" the product will become.

    <p>(This is a lot of information to collect, and you may not be able to find it all. But we pre-fill each element of information with stand-in, general text that you can use, as well as a rich set of <a href="https://jimaworks.com/pages/resources">hints and tips</a> to guide you on how to show what you do know and what you don’t.)</p>
    <p>(Moreover, you can always, at any time, use the SaveAndComeBackLater button, so you can go off and do some additional research before completing your project. When you do SaveAndComeBackLater, we save the state of your incomplete RelationShips project and send you a link which, when you click it, brings you back to the same place you left off, with your previous partially-complete information restored.)</p>
