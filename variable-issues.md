For Vasily:

[You have provided the fields; do you have any examples of the type of data seen in each? Wondering if we can draw ... Could you infer the mappings between localStorage and Illustrator based on default values?]

1. What is meant by “Date”? No localStorage variables found with “date” in the name.

For Jim:

1. What is meant by “Date info”? All 3 variables are missing on both the localStorage and Illustrator sides.

2. What is meant by “Additional Destination info (3 geo elements)”?

3. What is meant by “Additional Origin info (3 geo elements)”?

For either Jim or Vasily:

1. What is the difference between Commemoration Time Period Start/End (e) and Year?

2. What is the difference between Origins and Region? Using defaults, both read “EuropeAndTheMediterranean” at checkout.
